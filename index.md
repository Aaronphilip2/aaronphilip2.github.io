# About Me
Hi! I'm an undergraduate student at UCLA studying computer science. I'm passionate about computer science and all things machine learning. Basketball, football and disc golf aren't too bad either. 

## Activities

I'm currently an officer with [ACM AI at UCLA](https://github.com/uclaacmai), a club that strives to educate students on machine learning through workshops and projects. For the past year, I have been involved in developing and teaching both an advanced and beginner course on machine learning, covering topics like logistic regression, vanilla neural networks, and convolutional neural networks. This winter I will be working with another officer to spearhead a brand new seminar series on various deep learning models.

## Projects

Feel free to check out more in-depth descriptions of my projects [here](/projects).

### Semantic Segmentation of Faces

Since I like to use photoshop to put my friends' faces on other people, I decided that I would use what I had learned about deep learning to make that task eaiser.

Using Keras and Tensorflow, I was able to train a fully convolutional network to segment faces. After about 4 hours of training on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 over 9 epochs, the model got to about 92% accuracy. Now, I am using this model to create a website that will allow anyone to quickly and easily extract a face from an image.

Last year I was a part of a team that built an autonomous drone to compete in [AUVSI SUAS](http://www.auvsi-suas.org/), a competion where autonomous aerial vehichles perform various tasks like detection, classification and object avoidance.

I worked with the vision team. With Tensorflow, Keras, and OpenCV we trained a series of CNNs to perform classification on aerial images of shapes and letters and used K-means clustering to segment those images.
